I am a 3rd-year PhD candidate at Chair for Computer Aided Medical Procedures & Augmented Reality (CAMP), Technical University of Munich. My supervisors are PD Dr. Federico Tombari and Prof. Nassir Navab. I also work with Dr. Fabian Manhardt from Google. In 2020, I received my master degree at Department of Automation in Tsinghua University, under the supervision of Prof. Xiangyang Ji. In 2017, I received the B.Eng. degree at Department of Automation in Tsinghua University.


# Research
My research topic is object pose estimation and its applications in 3D part assembly, shape retrieval and robotic grasping.
